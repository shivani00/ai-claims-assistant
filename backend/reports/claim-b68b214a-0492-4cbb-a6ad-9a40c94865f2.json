      "Policy history explicitly shows a previous claim (CLM-2024-078 for Policy ID POLICY-123, dated 2024-08-15) was rejected with the reason 'Duplicate claim detected'. This directly aligns with 'Multiple claims within short duration' and 'Reused vehicle damage photos' as common fraud indicators.",
      "Government records indicate an over-speeding violation for vehicle 'KA01AB1234' on 2024-10-01 (post-dating the previously rejected claim but indicating recent driver/vehicle behavior), suggesting a propensity for risky driving behavior.",
      "The absence of 'imageAssessment' means there is no visual evidence to verify the reported damage, which is a critical gap for assessing claim legitimacy and detecting fraud indicators like reused or manipulated images."
    ]
  },
  "summary": "The claim exhibits a high risk primarily due to a documented history of a duplicate claim rejection (CLM-2024-078) for the same Policy ID (POLICY-123), which is a strong fraud indicator. Additionally, the associated vehicle has a recent over-speeding violation. The absence of an image assessment further restricts the ability to verify the physical evidence of damage, which is crucial for a comprehensive risk evaluation, especially concerning potential fraudulent practices like reusing damage photos.",
